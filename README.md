Overview

In here lies Bonis

The project is the start of the real time tracker of events taking place around the user. 

Environment Setup
-----------------

1. Install the nodejs
2. in the directory that contains the .json file type "npm install"
    This will install all the dependancies.
YOU MUST INSTALL YOUR OWN MYSQL SERVER AND SET UP THE DATABASE AND CHANGE THE CONNECTION STRING TO WHAT YOU SET UP. 
OR
YOU NEED TO LOG ONTO GODADDY AND ADD YOUR SERVER TO THE REMOTE ACCESS LIST UNDER CPANEL AND USE THE CONNECTION STRING ALREADY IN THE FILE. PLEASE DON'T PUSH A NEW FILE WITH YOUR CONNECTION STRING. 

Here is the website I got this skeleton from ref it while trying to get this project working.

Using mocha to run test code
---------------------------------------
will get to this after my dental visit. 

What this app does so far
----------------------------------------
This skeleton of an authtication for node and MySQL allows people to register for the website and that is pretty much the scope of it.
It uses passport so intergration of facebook logon and most social media login is pretty easy to do. 
It needs some improvements but for now we have something that we can test on build from. 
MeriaDB uses all the same commands as mySQL so it just takes us setting up a meriaDB database and connecting to that.
